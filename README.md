<h1> Human-Pose-Detection-and-analysis-using-Deep-Learning-</h1>
<p>
  This repository consists of the project involves an analysis of varius machine learning models designed for Human pose detection, specifically yoga pose detection, from Images and video feed. 
  We used the image dataset from Kaggle. <href>  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/yoga-poses-dataset </href>.
  We have used a collection of Machine learning and Deep Learning algorithm, mainly being Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Randomforest Classifier, LogisticRegression and GradientBoosting algorithms.
  We have designed the CNN using the Tensorflow and keras libraries and used the in-built Scikik-learn model with the default parameters for the other models.

  Deployed the model into an application using Streamlit as the frontend and FastAPI as the backend for the model.

  We have used the Mediapipe and OpenCV libraries for processing the images.
